When boy first opened his laptop, 
the word python was already on his mind. 
He launched his editor, typed a few lines of python code, 
and smiled as the script ran flawlessly. Later, he explored advanced python libraries, 
realizing how versatile python could be for web design, data analysis, and even automation. 
The more he practiced python, the more confident he became, until python felt less like a tool 
and more like a creative companion guiding his projects.
